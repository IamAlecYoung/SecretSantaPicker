# SecretSantaPicker

Simple Secret Santa picker, created in roughly four hours to mitigate the pandemics effects on our yearly in-person Secret Santa draw.

Little to no security (aside from PDO) as it was a 'one and done' type of project on an NGINX server.
Plan on revamping it for future years with a management suite to handle new years, clearing picks and other useful features.
